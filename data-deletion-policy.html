  <h2>Data Deletion Policy</h2>
  <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
  <p>This document sets out our policy for responding to requests for deletion of data under the
    GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which comes into force in May 2018. This
    document explains the rights of the data subject in relation to data deletion and the
  responsibilities of InWeb in responding with such a request.</p>
  <h3>2. Individual Rights</h3>
  <p>An individual has the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. The principle
underpinning this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of
personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.</p>
<h3>3. When does the right to erasure apply?</h3>
<p>As stipulated in the GDPR, individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent
processing in specific circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it
was originally collected/processed;</li>
  <li>When the individual withdraws consent;</li>
  <li>When the individual objects to the processing and there is no other legal ground for the relevant processing activity;</li>
  <li>When the personal data was unlawfully processed;</li>
  <li>Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation;</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. What information does InWeb retain?</h3>
<p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other contact information, preferences and use of our services. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in our privacy policy, which can be found at: <a href="https://inwebgames.github.io/takazo/">https://inwebgames.github.io/takazo/</a>
</p>
<h3>5. How can data be deleted?</h3>
<p>
  A system administrator (individual user acting on behalf of their organization) can delete data
from their Interplace system whenever they wish. This data is deleted from the system
immediately and cannot be recovered by any users or InWeb employees after this point. Data
which has been deleted or otherwise destroyed can not be recovered at any time. Sufficient
warning is given to the account administrator before they permanently delete anything.
Data may still remain in the systems back-up files, which will be deleted periodically.
</p>
<p>
  Information may be deleted from our databases upon request to <a href="mailto:inwebgames@gmail.com">inwebgames@gmail.com</a> We
undertake to perform the deletion within one month (30 calendar days) and will send you a
confirmation once the information has been deleted. Wherever possible, we will aim to
complete the request in advance of the deadline
